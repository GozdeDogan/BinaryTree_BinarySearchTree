# BinaryTree_BinarySearchTree

1. Extend BinaryTree class to implement Iterable interface. The iterator
should traverse the binary tree pre-order.

2. Extend BinarySearchTree class from BinaryTree class. BinarySearchTree
class should have an extra iterator method levelOrderIterator which
returns an Iterator that traverses the binary search tree in level order.

Test:
Write your traverse methods such that they print each traversed node to
console. Read integers (separated by sapces) from test.txt
